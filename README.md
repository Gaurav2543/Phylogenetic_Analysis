# Phylogenetic_Analysis

Part1:
Construct a phylogenetic relationship for the given nucleotide sequences (Nucleotide.txt).
a. Write a script to generate a distance matrix csv file for the sequences present in the
data file. Name the distance matrix file as 'Ndistance.txt'.
For example,
seq1 = 'ATGCATGCAA'
seq2 = 'ATGCATGCTA'
Distance (seq1, seq2) = Mismatches/total length = 1/10 = 0.1
b. Write a script that uses 'Ndistance.txt' and generate phylogenetic relationship
between the organisms using UPGMA method.

Part2:
Construct a phylogenetic relationship for the given protein sequences (Protein.txt).
a. Write a script to generate a distance matrix csv file for the sequences present in the
data file. Name the distance matrix file as 'Pdistance.txt'. Use BLOSUM62 for getting score
values.
b. Write a script that uses 'Pdistance.txt' and generate phylogenetic relationship between
the organisms using UPGMA method.
