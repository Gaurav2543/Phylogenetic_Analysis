Please ensure that the ".txt" files are in the same folder as relative path is given. Some libraries need to be installed for appropriate working.

### For Part1:
I have made the distance matrix. It takes about 40 seconds for program to complete, so you might have to wait for some time for the output after execution of the program. The progam takes the input from the file "Nucleotide.txt". The output tree has been drawn by hand along with the distances being specified alongside and the image has been uploaded as "Tree1.jpeg" based on the output of the program, stored in the file "Ndistance.txt".

### For Part2:
I have made the closeness matrix (i.e. the closer the proteins are, more their score). The progam takes the input from the file "Protein.txt". The output tree has been drawn by hand along with the distances being specified alongside and the image has been uploaded as "Tree2.jpeg" based on the output of the program, stored in the file "Pdistance.txt". The reference used for the calculation in this program is the BLOSUM62 distance matrix, which is present as "BLOSUM62.txt". The orientation of the tree is different than the one in Part1 since the closeness matrix indicates score and not the distance.
